# Programming

Hey! Welcome to my repository, I will practice and push all sort of Algorithms and problem solving questions I practice and solve.

I plan to solve atleast one problem and learn some stuff everyday. I hope for the best of my consistency.

## Usage

Yeah, There isn't any thing to preach here. Its pretty much most basic coding setup for JS.

Just install a code-runner extension in your vscode (recommended) or just run it via live server on your browser.

Enjoy!
