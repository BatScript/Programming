# Programming

Hey! Welcome to my repository, I will practice and push all sort of Algorithms and problem solving questions I practice and solve. I will also be pushing all the concepts that I learn along the way.

## Usage

Yeah, There isn't any thing to preach here. Its pretty much most basic coding setup for JS.

run `node <file>`
if you use nodemon,
run `nodemon <file>`

Clone and Enjoy!
